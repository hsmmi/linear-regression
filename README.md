# linear-regression
Linear regression tries to model the relationship between two variables by applying a linear equation to a series of data.
Your task is to train linear model on the given datasets.
Implement linear regression using closed form solution and the Gradient Descent algorithm (Batch or Stochastic, only one) and test your implementation on the given Test Dataset.
• Use the Data-Train to train your model, and test on the Data-Test.
• Plot of the datasets and regression lines.
• Plot cost function for enough iteration for linear regression in Gradient Descent (Batch or stochastic, only one).
• Report the learned parameters (θ0 , θ1 , ..., θn ), and also the value of MSE error on the train and test data.
• Do not forget that you could normalize the data.
